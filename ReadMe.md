### - What is a death mask?
*A death mask is a cast of a dead person*, usually made of wax or plaster. Death masks used to preserve the identity of a person, so that, for example, portraits could be made later.

In the late Middle Ages, ambitious princes and ecclesiastical leaders had their portraits spread throughout their empire. It was advertising for themselves, and it legitimized their rule. *A cast of their lifeless face showed that their power, the power of the dynasty, was unbroken even after death*.

From the seventeenth century, when the bourgeoisie became more powerful and self-aware, death masks by scientists, artists and writers were introduced. *More than through painted portraits, they live on after their death*. A well-known example is the death mask of Isaac Newton (1643-1727).

*In the eighteenth century, there was much interest in death masks and they were collected*. Enthusiasts tried to gather as large a collection of "celebrities" as possible and, especially in countries such as England and France, special galleries with masks of famous dead and executed criminals were created.
