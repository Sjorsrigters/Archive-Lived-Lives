### What is a death mask?
*A death mask is a cast of a dead person*, usually made of wax or plaster. Death masks used to preserve the identity of a person, so that, for example, portraits could be made later.

In the late Middle Ages, ambitious princes and ecclesiastical leaders had their portraits spread throughout their empire. It was advertising for themselves, and it legitimized their rule. *A cast of their lifeless face showed that their power, the power of the dynasty, was unbroken even after death*.

From the seventeenth century, when the bourgeoisie became more powerful and self-aware, death masks by scientists, artists and writers were introduced. *More than through painted portraits, they live on after their death*. A well-known example is the death mask of Isaac Newton (1643-1727).

*In the eighteenth century, there was much interest in death masks and they were collected*. Enthusiasts tried to gather as large a collection of "celebrities" as possible and, especially in countries such as England and France, special galleries with masks of famous dead and executed criminals were created.

[...] As Nick Reynolds will tell you, death masks began in antiquity — the most famous being the funerary mask of [Tutankhamun.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_of_Tutankhamun) Wealthy Romans ritually kept death masks of their ancestors for display and worship. *The Victorians too were briefly obsessed* — according to the Victorian science of phrenology, you could determine a person's character and personality from the shape of his head. From the 1820s to the 1840s, a leading British phrenologist and mask-maker, James de Ville, accumulated some 2,000 specimens.

## L'Inconnue de la Seine

She's known simply as "L'Inconnue de la Seine" (The unknown woman of the Seine). So the story goes, her body was retrieved from the river in Paris in the 1870s or 1880s -- no one has an exact date. She'd apparently drowned herself. *An attendant at the morgue was so moved by her beauty and youth (she may well have been a teenager) that he ordered a plaster mold of her face.*

In the following decades, *her death mask was much reproduced, in effect becoming an objet d'art.* Among her 20th century admirers were Giacometti, Man Ray, Vladimir Nabokov and Albert Camus referred to her as the "drowned Mona Lisa."

[...] Laerdal kept the name of his Anne doll, but gave the new mannequin L'Inconnue's face, along with a body of full sized adult dimensions – *including a collapsible chest for practising compressions, and open lips to simulate mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.*
